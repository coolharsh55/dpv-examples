# dpv-examples
A collection of examples highlighting the use of Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) 

To contribute an example, please submit a PR. To request an example, please open a new issue.

## notes on examples

1. Each example should preferably be submitted in easy to read serialisations such as RDF/Turtle, unless there is a good reason to do otherwise. For example, using JSON-LD code could be relevant when describing web requests.
2. Each example should preferably be accompanied with a description (text/markdown file) that we can link to in the GitHub repository. This will allow a casual user to browse through the examples with some form of _documentation_.
3. Examples can also be submitted to raise / discuss decisions about design, specification, use of concepts, etc. This presumes such discussions taking place via issues and PR requests. For more context, please also see the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/) for discussions.
4. Examples can also be used to introduce new concepts/features - such items must be clearly labeled and indicated (as not being part of DPV).
5. Examples can also be used to demonstrate comparison / inclusion / incorporation of DPV with other systems/tools/vocabularies.
